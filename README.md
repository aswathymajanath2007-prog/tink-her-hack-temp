# Luna- for women, by women

## Basic Details

### Team Name: SuuperGurl

### Team Members
- Member 1: Aswathy M S - Christ College of Engineering, Irinjalakuda

### Hosted Project Link
http://localhost:5173/

### Project Description
Luna is an exclusive platform built for women, focusing on safety, dignity, and mutual support.
By leveraging location-based alerts, the app enables women to respond to emergency sanitary needs through a trusted community network.

### The Problem statement
Menstrual emergencies are common yet often unsupported situations faced by women. Unexpected periods and lack of sanitary products can cause stress, discomfort, and embarrassment. There is no secure, location-based platform that connects women in need with trusted nearby helpers in real time.

### The Solution
To solve unexpected period emergencies, Luna enables women to send emergency pad requests exclusively to their followers using location-based alerts. This follower-only approach creates a safe, trusted support network where women can receive timely help without compromising privacy.
Luna aims to bridge the gap through a safe, private, and community-driven solution.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**
- Languages used: Python, HTML, CSS
- Frameworks used: None (Built using core Python and basic web technologies)
- Libraries used: antigravity (Python built-in module)
- Tools used: VS Code, Git, Git Bash, Git Hub

---

## Features

List the key features of your project:
- Feature 1: Emergency Sanitary Alert System
Users can send an emergency alert requesting a sanitary pad, tampon, or menstrual cup. The alert is shared only with the user’s followers within a 3 km radius, ensuring a trusted and localized support network.
- Feature 2: Privacy-First Acceptance Flow
Recipients can choose to accept or ignore the alert. The requester’s name and live location are revealed only after the recipient accepts, maintaining user privacy and safety at all stages.
- Feature 3: Location-Based Matching
The system uses location data to notify only nearby followers, enabling faster response times and minimizing unnecessary exposure.
- Feature 4: Women-Only Safe Space
Luna is exclusively designed for women, creating a secure environment for sharing concerns, asking questions, and seeking support without fear or discomfort.
